#  Analysis Plan sex stratify Autosomal chr

the purpose of this pipeline is to provide detail on sex stratif analysis for CAD . 
Please test additive models using logistic regression, accounting for genotype imputation uncertainty (i.e. SNP probability or dosage).

## Section 1: Analysis pipeline
Primary model here will be:
a. Males: CAD(all CAD cases vs. all non-CAD controls) = $SNP + Study covariates 
b. Females: CAD (all CAD cases vs. all non-CAD controls) = $SNP + Study covariates 

### 1. Example script using PLINK
### 2. Example script using REGENIE
### 3. Example script using SAIGE

## Section 2: description data to be provided


***Note: For studies that have already conducted analyses, please discuss the models used (for example, some studies may have already adjusted for age and this is not considered a material deviation from the analysis plan). Use study appropriate software to account for (or exclude as appropriate) relatedness.***
***If undertaking new analyses to contribute then the following approach is advised. If providing previously generated results, please ensure the approach is documented and discuss any major deviations***
