#  Analysis Plan sex stratify Autosomal chr

the purpose of this pipeline is to provide detail on sex stratif analysis for CAD . 
Please test additive models using logistic regression, accounting for genotype imputation uncertainty (i.e. SNP probability or dosage).

## Section 1: Analysis pipeline
Primary model here will be:
a. Males: CAD(all CAD cases vs. all non-CAD controls) = $SNP + Study covariates 
b. Females: CAD (all CAD cases vs. all non-CAD controls) = $SNP + Study covariates 

For studies that have already conducted analyses, please discuss the models used (for example, some studies may have already adjusted for age and this is not considered a material deviation from the analysis plan). Use study appropriate software to account for (or exclude as appropriate) relatedness.
If undertaking new analyses to contribute then the following approach is advised. If providing previously generated results, please ensure the approach is documented and discuss any major deviations: 
Primary model:
1.	CAD (all CAD cases vs. all non-CAD controls) = study specific covariates (e.g. PCs) + Sex + SNP
